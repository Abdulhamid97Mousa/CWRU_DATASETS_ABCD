# CWRU-dataset
Case Western Reserve University Bearing Fault Dataset

https://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/download-data-file

Data presented here were collected for - Bearings Fault Diagnosis
  1. normal bearings, 
  2. single-point drive end  
  3. fan end defects.  

Data collected at 12,000 samples/second and at 48,000 samples/second for drive end bearing experiments.  
All fan end bearing data was collected at 12,000 samples/second.  

Data files are in Matlab format.  
Each file contains - 
  1. fan and 
  2. drive end vibration data as well as 
  3. motor rotational speed.  
    For all files, the following item in the variable name indicates:
      
    DE - drive end accelerometer data

    FE - fan end accelerometer data

    BA - base accelerometer data

    time - time series data

    RPM- rpm during testing
